+ First have a look at this docs first.

	+ [1.md](./docs/command_history/1.md)

	+ [2.md](./docs/command_history/2.md)

	+ [3.md](./docs/command_history/3.md)

	+ [4.md](./docs/command_history/4.md)

	+ [5.md](./docs/command_history/5.md)

+ In `cookbook/urls.py`, add the following lines just after import statements

```python
# Admin Interface: change site-header, site-title & index-title 
admin.site.site_header = "Admin Interface Cookbook"
admin.site.site_title = "Customizing Admin Interface"
admin.site.index_title = "Apps and related models"
```

so that will look like below
